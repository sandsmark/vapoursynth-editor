Vapoursynth Editor Sandsmark
----------------------------

I'm not very good with names, but this is my fork of the original version.


Improvements and new features
========================

 - Integration of [FakeVim](https://github.com/hluk/FakeVim), an extremely
   faithful re-implementation of vim. Includes support for loading your vimrc.
 - Dark mode support, based on [qdarkstyle](https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet).
 - Improved FPS calculation in the benchmarking.
 - "#define" support, to re-use variables from python in the encoding dialog.
 - UI fixes, e. g. improved sizes of clickable areas/hitboxes, missing icons, etc.
 - General fixes, e. g. loading wrong preset in encoding dialog, loading of style colors.
 - General code clean up, build system fixing, bug fixing.
